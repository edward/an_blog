# An Blog Maker

This is a tool that helps with the writing process of blogs, aka articles or essays intended for consumption on the web.

## Backstory
This is an idea born out of wanting to read text next to text but it was hard.

My friend and colleague Alaine wrote up this presentation called “How to blog more good”, which explained a script to follow to produce successful web content.

This presentation was great – it broke down the chunks of a meaningful and articulate article intended for consumption on the web and was very nice but it was also a little tough for me to apply as I wrote an article.

There would be times where I would be like “okay, I am writing this one part that Alaine calls ‘the message’, but how is that different than the parts before and after? What are these things again?” I would end up copy/pasting descriptions of things around and it made things harder to read and write as I shoved descriptions of parts of the script around, etc.

If only there was a web page in which I could reliably type things, the things would be saved offline, and descriptions of each part of the script were there, as side-notes. Edward Tufte was once kind of a jerk to me to my face, but he definitely got a bunch of things right, and his identification of side-notes as rad beasts of information layout is correct. I am still a little sad about that time though.

## Usage

Double-click on `index.html` and it should open in a web browser. Then read the things on the side and type in the inputs. Stop when there are enough words and then copy/paste the chunks into a publishing space. You’re now pretty much an auteur. Respect.
